Format: Four sets of numbers (0-255) separated by dots.
Example: 192.168.1.1
Limit: Supports about 4.3 billion unique addresses.
Problem: Limited supply, leading to IPv6 adoption.

IPv6 (Internet Protocol Version 6)
Format: Eight groups of hexadecimal numbers separated by colons.
Example: 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334
Limit: Supports trillions of unique addresses (almost infinite).
Why Needed? IPv4 addresses are running out due to increased internet usage.

what is localhost
Localhost refers to the loopback address of a computer, meaning it points to itself. 
It is used for testing and development without needing an internet connection.
âœ… Localhost IP Address: 127.0.0.1 (IPv4) or ::1 (IPv6)
âœ… Used by developers to test websites, applications, and servers locally.
When you enter localhost in your browser, your computer redirects the request 
to itself instead of searching on the internet.
